As [Anna Tsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Tsing) wrote in her marvellous book **Mushroom at the end of the world** : 

> Everyone carries a history of contamination, purity is not an option.

This short sentence largely includes lot of the visions and needs that shaped our last years of development around Bonfire.

As we - in the first place - are building this piece of software for us and for the communities we care about, we strive for diversity and flexibility in every aspect of the bonfire codebase.

We want each bonfire instance to be different and unique in its own particular way, until it serves the same range of purposes of all the other bonfires:

To create a safe place for users to stay, interact and create their own culture, remaining in control of their own activities and data - meanwhile being able to communicate with the fediverse at their own pace and under their own conditions.

It is no wonder then that words like **contamination**, **diversity**, **anarchism**, **ecosystem**, and **bottom up** were the most used during our brainstorming about the new bonfire branding.

We all firmly agreed from the beginning that the Bonfire visual identity must reflect such topics without obfuscating itself under an overly clean and minimalist design. We enjoy navigating through complexity, without the burning desire to control everything.

Other than a social network, bonfire is a playground and experimentation platform, we are learning to take care of it and take care of ourselves through it - building it in the open so that the experience can be expanded to many other peers.

We had the pleasure to work with [Rocco Lombardi](http://lalberosfregiato.blogspot.com/), a talented artist that lives somewhere near the Bolognese Apennines. He guided us and transformed our wishes into awesome illustrations and images.

We asked Rocco to work with us on the visual identity primarly because of the style and subjects of his artwork.

Forests and trees that emerges by scratching out the light from black paper, animals that fight capitalism, all sort of organics - wild and lived entities contaminate his drawings and we wanted that world to contaminate bonfire software as well.

The result is definitely in tune with our expectations - as we all agreed to have a visual identity that could replace the flat, metallic, minimalistic, silicon valley style that has dominated the web in recent years - we hope you like it too.

As we're progressing toward a first release of our software, we are happy to have added this important step and we thank Rocco to have joined us on this journey.:)
