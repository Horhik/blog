We are so pleased to announce that Bonfire has been awarded with the [Culture of Solidarity Fund](https://culturalfoundation.eu/stories/culture-of-solidarity-fund/) from the [European Cultural foundation](https://culturalfoundation.eu/) to support cross-border cultural initiatives of solidarity in times of uncertainty and infodemic. 

The grant will be used to release our bonfire social beta and to develop Zappa: a custom bonfire extension to empower communities with a dedicated tool to deal with the coronavirus infodemic and online misinformation in general. 

## The Zappa extension

Zappa is powered by user communities' assessments of content (links, news, video, pictures) to develop common practices and patterns to fight fake news. 
Such assessments which will then be used to train artificial intelligence engines. The user ratings and AI predictions will together generate decentralised "Zappa scores": helping users to classify and act upon content based on each communityâ€™s methodology and preferences. 
We didn't went way more far than this in outlining how zappa will work in details, we all have lot of plans in this regard, but we want to co-design it together with interested communites.
For the time being we prefer to [stay with ambiguity](https://dougbelshaw.com/ambiguity/) as much as possible, and we welcome you to join the discussion and participate.

## How to follow zappa development?
- We will keep track of our work and deliverables on [github milestones](https://github.com/bonfire-networks/bonfire-app/milestones).
- Feedbacks and open discussions will take place on the [zappa topic]() on the socialhub forum (we may create several topics when needed)
- You are welcome to join the [Bonfire public chat](https://matrix.to/#/#bonfire-networks:matrix.org) and engage with us

As always, we will report progresses and news here on the bonfire blog, so stay tuned!
